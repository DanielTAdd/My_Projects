# My_Projects
#In this project, a data-driven model was developed in a python IDE for predicting rate of penetration of a drillstring in downstream Petroleum Engineering drilling operations.
#The Data was obtained from the Utah- Forge field, Well 58-32.
#The dataset include drilling data such as Rate of Penetration (ROP) as the target variable and other drilling variables such as Depth, Rotation per minute (RPM), 
#Stand Pipe Pressure (SPP) and Drilling Torque amongsts others as indicated in the Jupyter notebook attached. 
#The CRISP-DM methodology was followed in the project and Sci-kit learn was mainly deployed amongst other libraries. 
#The workflow and the results from the model are described in the jupyter notebook attached.
